# Triminoe Project 

## What is this project?

During a Discrete Mathematics course I took at college, we had a sample question on a review for one of our tests. It asked us to prove using strong induction that we could fill out a board of size 2^n * 2^n with triminoes providing that one square is missing. As I made my way through the problem I thought it would be fun to implement a visualization for the problem.

## How to use

First run Mainframe.java and input your parameters:

![form](.\triminoeForm.png)

Then press submit and watch as the triminoes are placed onto our board. THe complete board should look like this:

![completeBoard](.\completeBoard.png)

PS: if the board looks off just resize the window and it should be fine
